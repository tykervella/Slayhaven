## DESCRIPTION 

Week 20 Challenge for Full-Stack Programming bootcamp at the University of Washington in partnership with edX. This is my second go at a portfolio! I used react, bootstrap and my own css styling to show off my works and let potential employers know more about me.

## INSTALLATION 

This project is meant to be viewed at the deployment link included within this README. No installation required!

---


## USAGE

This runs in the browser at the deployed link! 

You start by viewing the <b>About</b> page to learn a bit more about me. You can then navigate to Portfolio, Resume or Contact from the Nav element in the top right corner of the page. 

Clicking <b>Portfolio</b> will display my five most recent projects, with a featured project highlighted at the top of the page. Each project contains a title, description and can be clicked to navigate to that project's corresponding github repository. 

Clicking <b>Resume</b> will allow the viewer to click on an embedded link and download my resume. It also showcases badges of the top 12 marketable skills I have to offer for easy viewing.

Finally, clicking on <b>Contact</b> will render a form that allows the user to enter their name, email and a brief message. This form does not currently work. 

At the bottom of the page, links to my linked in, github and my phone number are displayed

## CONTRIBUTIONS
