            <h2>Archetypes</h2>

            <p>
                Archetypes, in the context of storytelling and character creation, are universally recognizable elements or figures that recur across different cultures and eras. They form the heart of our shared human experiences and tales, encompassing broad categories of characters who embody specific traits, roles, and patterns. In this campaign, you will chose from one of five archetypes for your character: the Damager, the Healer, the Protector, the Trickster, or the Expert. Each archetype represents a distinct facet of the heroic journey, shaping the course of the narrative and driving the team's success through their unique contributions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mechanically speaking, choosing an archetype will grant you additional active and passive abilities as your character reaches certain levels. Each archetype has a combination of passive and active abilities that are available for your characters to learn. You will choose one passive ability for your character at levels 2 and 6 and one active ability for your character at levels 5 and 9.

                        The Damager is a raw  power within the group, often acting primarily as an offensive unit. Equipped with formidable weapons or destructive magic, they wield strength with unflinching boldness, tearing through enemy lines and reducing obstacles to rubble. While they can occasionally seem brash or uncontrollable, their courage is undeniable, and their role is pivotal in any battle. However, their power often comes with a price â€“ an internal struggle, a dangerous secret, or a past that continues to haunt them.
