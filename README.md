## DESCRIPTION 

Single Page react site created as an information hub for my new dnd campaign. This project utilizes react and react-bootstrap to create a mobile-first front-end that is organized to quickly and easily allow users to find the information. The campaign setting is based off of the Strixhaven: Curriculum of Chaos module, with elements of my own homebrew added to flush out the setting!
